# Calculator

A modern, interactive calculator web app built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, state management, and responsive UI—all in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## ✨ Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern look that works on any device
- **Keyboard Support**: Use your keyboard for all calculator functions
- **Decimal & Backspace**: Input floating point numbers and correct mistakes easily
- **Smart Input Handling**: Prevents invalid input (e.g., multiple decimals, consecutive operators)
- **Snarky Division by Zero**: Fun error message if you try to divide by zero
- **Rounded Results**: Long decimals are rounded for a tidy display
- **Clear Button**: Instantly reset the calculator

## 🖼️ Demo

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Click the buttons or use your keyboard to enter numbers and operations
3. Press `=` or `Enter` to calculate
4. Use `C` or `Escape` to clear, and `⌫` or `Backspace` to delete the last digit
